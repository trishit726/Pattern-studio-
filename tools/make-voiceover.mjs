This is Pattern Studio.
Describe your brand, and A.I. designs the whole title. The headline. The colours. The motion.
And every piece stays yours to control.
Pick a style. Let the shapes gather around your words... or flood the screen in colour.
Sync it to the beat. Then render, and your brand is in motion.
Pattern Studio. Open source, and made for everyone.`,

You describe your brand, in one line.
The editor — a React app — sends it to a local render server.
The server calls Gemini, which designs a complete scene, and returns it as structured data.
That scene drops straight into a live Remotion preview, where you can edit anything.
When you're happy, one click sends it back — and the server renders your scene with Remotion, into a finished M P 4.
From a sentence, to a video. Editor, server, A.I., and Remotion.`,
