## ✨ Inspiration

**Every creator wants their videos to look *rich* — professional, branded, like a real channel.** And the thing that does that is the **title** — the bold, animated opener that makes people stop scrolling.

But making one is a wall. After Effects takes months to learn. A motion designer costs money you don't have. And template tools all spit out the same intros everyone's already seen. So most creators settle for plain text — or nothing.

I wanted a tool where **any creator can design that rich title section themselves** — in a browser, in minutes. That's **Pattern Studio**.

## 🎬 What it does

**Design a broadcast-quality animated title card, edit every part of it, and export a real video.**

At its heart is a **procedural pattern engine** I built — a deterministic, seeded system that scatters geometric shapes around heavy condensed type and drives the animation. On top sits a **live editor** where everything is yours to change:

- 🎛️ **Full control** — drag the title, recolour each block, pick from 16 shapes, tune density & spacing, add music, save & reload.
- 🌊 **Two motion styles** — shapes that *scatter* around the title, or a *flood* intro that fills the frame and clears.
- 🎨 **On-brand by design** — pick a palette and the whole scene follows it.
- 📐 **Export anywhere** — MP4, WebM, or GIF, in any ratio (16:9, 9:16 for Shorts/TikTok, 1:1) from a single render.
- ⚡ **Optional fast start** — describe a brand in a sentence and the studio drafts an editable scene for you.

Different inputs → genuinely different looks, because the engine composes the palette, type, and pattern to fit the brief — not just fill a template:

## 🛠️ How I built it

The whole thing is one pipeline: **describe → editable scene → rendered video.**

</p>

1. **The pattern engine** — a deterministic, seeded generator (TypeScript) that places the shapes and drives the *flood* intro. Same seed → same frames, so the live preview and the final MP4 match exactly.
2. **The editor** — **Next.js 16 + React 19** around a live **Remotion Player** preview, so you see changes instantly.
3. **The animation** — every graphic is a **Remotion** composition: motion written as React + TypeScript, fully programmable.
4. **The render** — a **Remotion + ffmpeg** render server bundles the scene, renders a real 1080p **H.264 MP4**, then derives every other ratio/format from that one render with ffmpeg.

## 🗄️ Why DynamoDB (the data model I'm proud of)

Instead of dumping scenes in a list, I designed a proper **AWS DynamoDB single-table model**. Every user owns **one partition**, holding both their saved scenes *and* their render history — so all of a user's data comes back in a **single Query**, never a table Scan.

</p>

- **Ownership is enforced by the key** — a caller can only ever address items inside their own `USER#<id>` partition.
- A **sparse GSI** lists a user's scenes by most-recently-edited; render events omit the index attributes, so they never cost anything on it.
- One table, clear access patterns (`getScene`, `listScenes`, `saveScene`, `recordRender`, `listRenders`) — the kind of model I'd defend in an interview.

## 🧗 Challenges I ran into

- **Determinism.** A live preview is useless if the final render differs. Making the pattern engine fully seeded — so preview and MP4 are frame-identical — took real care.
- **One render, many formats.** Re-rendering per ratio was slow and re-laid-out the design. Rendering once at 1080p and cropping with ffmpeg kept it intact and fast.
- **A render bug, found live.** Uploaded background photos 404'd at render time, because the renderer snapshots its asset folder once at bundle time. I fixed it by passing photos through as data URLs the renderer resolves directly.
- **Modelling the database properly** — learning single-table design instead of reaching for a relational schema.

## 🏆 Accomplishments I'm proud of

- A **complete, working pipeline** from an idea to a downloadable, broadcast-quality video — not a mockup.
- Output that **doesn't look templated** — different inputs, genuinely different brands.
- A real, defensible **full-stack build** (procedural engine + Remotion + Next.js + DynamoDB) shipped solo.

## 📚 What I learned

- **Motion graphics as code** with Remotion, and how to make a generator deterministic.
- **Procedural design** — composing type, colour, and pattern from rules instead of templates.
- **Cloud data modelling** with DynamoDB single-table design.
- That with the right tools, **one person can build like a team.**

## 🚀 What's next

- **Brand-kit memory** — reuse a logo, fonts, and palette across scenes.
- More intro transitions and shape packs.
- **Direct social publishing** + a hosted render queue so anyone can use it without running it locally.
